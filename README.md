## Microsoft Azure Subscription

All students should have this from Basic Training, to check, visit the [Microsoft Azure Portal](http://portal.azure.com) and check the Subscriptions tab to ensure you have either a "Dreamspark" or "Imagine" subscription listed.

If you don't, then visit [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) to register yourself as a student, verify and activate Azure through the links on the site.

Next up, you need to create a Bot Service in Azure, which you can do here [https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.BotApp](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.BotApp). We reccomend you select a new resource group as well.

# [Why React + Typescript?](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-why-a-guide-to-using-typescript-with-react-fffb76c61614)

TypeScript is a free, open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language.

We will be using [TypeScript React Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter) maintained by Microsoft for phase 1 training.
